        <p>A time would come when men should be able to stretch out their eyes... as i looked out into space, i was overwhelmed by the darkness. as you sit here you realize that man will never conquer space. every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. for the past 50 years, everyday people have thought they would be able to go into space within the next 10 to 20 years. i have been judged vehemently suspect of heresy, that is, of having held and believed that the sun in the centre of the universe and immoveable, and that the earth is not at the center of same, and that it does move. i really didn't appreciate the first planet [earth] until i saw the second one... i think all i said was, "wow! jeez!" not exactly immortal.</p>

        <p>A few million years ago there were no humans. a spacecraft is a metaphor of national inspiration: majestic, technologically advanced, produced at dear cost and entrusted with precious cargo, rising above the constraints of the earth. anyone who sits on top of the largest hydrogen-oxygen fueled system in the world; knowing they're going to light the bottom*and doesn't get a little worried*does not fully understand the situation. armstrong's next words, right after the small step, show the expert descriptive test pilot at work: i regard any notion concerning the true mean it will open to him the gates of heaven. neither may the obscuring patches be clouds of vapor. no matter what we do now, the russians will beat us to the moon... the desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise.</p>
